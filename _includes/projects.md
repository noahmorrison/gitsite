#### [chevron](https://github.com/noahmorrison/chevron) -- python ####

A rendering engine for the mustache templating language (http://mustache.github.io)
Faster then the other popular implementations in python,
and most importantly it's spec compliant.



#### [wmup](https://github.com/noahmorrison/wmup) -- python ####

A custom post uploader for wordpress powered websites.
It is powered by a simple configuration file and executable scripts.


#### [haskoban](https://github.com/noahmorrison/haskoban) -- haskell ####

Sokoban written in haskell with editable levels and a simple terminal interface


#### [surs](https://github.com/noahmorrison/surs) -- rust ####

A sudoko solver written in rust. A brand new project that currently only loads
boards and doesn't actually solve them. Although I have written a solver in python before.
