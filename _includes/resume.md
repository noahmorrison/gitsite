Noah Morrison
-------------
I am a sophomore high school student looking for experience
in Software Engineering.

Coding has been my passion since I learned Python a few summers ago.

My idea of fun is picking a language or tool that people deem as hard
and learning it just to prove I can.
Haskell, Common lisp, and ed are some examples of this. Do hard things, right?

Projects
--------

Faster than the other popular implementations in Python,
and most importantly it's spec compliant.

#### surs -- Rust ####

A sudoku solver written in Rust. A brand new project that currently only loads
boards and doesn't actually solve them. Although I have written a solver in Python before.

#### Tri-state Baptist Church -- Wordpress/PHP ####

I have done some work on Tri-state Baptist Church's
website (powered by wordpress).
